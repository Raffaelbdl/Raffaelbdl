If you have reached here, I sincerly thank you for taking the time to read my profile.

What I show here is the top of the iceberg of all the prototypes that I would rather not show üòÇ. 

I spend most of my time trying new ideas, constantly learning new things and diving deep into new fields. Because that is what drives me.
