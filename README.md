## About me ðŸ˜Ž

I'm Raffael ! I love working on new projects, either dev oriented or research oriented.

I'm fond of Artificial Intelligence, and in particular Reinforcement Learning ! ðŸ¤–

My goal is to understand intelligence one day, or at least to make an AI that looks intelligent :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
